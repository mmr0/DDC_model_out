# DDC_model_out
Model output from large-eddy simulation of the ice-ocean boundary layer at conditions farvourable to double-diffusive convection.

The model domain consists of a horizontal, planar ice-ocean interface with ocean below. The governing equations and numerical implementation for the code,
as well as the problem set up and forcing, are described in [cite paper here].

The 5 simulations in this directory span a range of free stream velocities (U0) and temperatures (T0):
A1: U0=0.0 cm/s; T0 = -2.1 deg. C
B1: U0=0.7 cm/s; T0 = -2.1 deg. C
C1: U0=1.4 cm/s; T0 = -2.1 deg. C
C2: U0=1.4 cm/s; T0 = -1.9 deg. C
D1: U0=2.0 cm/s; T0 = -2.1 deg. C
